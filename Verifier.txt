7. Integrations into major TON explorers are currently underway and now are being further extended to Getters. The SDK in ton-community Github allows any TON explorer to embed Verifier into their front end and now utilize the getting functionality. 
8. Verified source code is an important aspect of smart contracts, as it provides transparency and allows users to assess the integrity and security of a contract. It would be cool to add Verifier to official TON tutorials for dapp developers.
