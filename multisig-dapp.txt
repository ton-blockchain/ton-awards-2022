1. Multisig dApp
2. dApp to interact with Multi-Signature wallets on TON
3. All functional is complete (except for ton connnect 2.0 support). It was manually tested (not fully)
4. https://github.com/Gusarich/multisig-dapp
5. Daniil Sedov (@Gusarich, js) and Michael Andreev (@Miandic, interface)
6. Several weeks, but it could have been done a lot faster (we weren't experienced in TON at the start of development)
7. Add ton connect 2.0 as soon as they allow signing of custom data; rework some parts of code; use our other development https://github.com/puppycats/multisig instead of raw work with cells; use ton-access (by orbs) instead of toncenter
8. It would be cool if a TF designer make a nice design for us, so that we'll implement it
9. 550 TON from TF
