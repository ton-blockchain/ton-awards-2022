8. TON-Access was created after learning from some of the failings of Ethereum which heavily relies on centralized rpc providers such as Infura. Decentralized projects such as pokt.network were created in the Ethereum ecosystem to overcome this problem. TON-Access follows a similar design. 
We think this is a crucial piece of infrastructure to any ecosystem and would love for the TON foundation to add TON Access as an official TON tool for TON devs.
