1. Tones of Rav
2. A betting game, where you have to guess how the price of TON will be affected in a fixed amount of time.
3. Game is already working in https://t.me/tones_ravw
4. https://github.com/SsNiPeR1/Tones_of_Rav
5. @SsNiPeR1, and @ravvw (Telegram)
6. About two weeks, but we often update it.
7. We plan to add a referral system in future, and free starting balance of 0.2 TON for players with Telegram Premium.
8. It would be great if you've posted a link to the game somewhere, so people would subscribe and play it.
9. Unfortunately, game is still really new, we did not receive any awards.
