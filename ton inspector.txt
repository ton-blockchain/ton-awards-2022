5. Kirill Melcin. I've already made dApp for ton: https://kirillmelcin.ru/archived/ton-spy/ and i'm currently developing a big commercial project in which i used Ton inspector (dm me for more info)
6. I didn't spend a lot of time developing the Ton inspector because i used the code i wrote for my commercial project
