1. Port of TON Tools to adJ.
2. adJ is a distribution of the secure operating system OpenBSD. I could port TON tools (i.e <https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton>) to it and also advanced in a port of `mytonctrl`  (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl)
3. I have been promoting the usage of these ports specially among spanish speakers OpenBSD users. I participated in the last 2 FunC contests of 2022 with these tools.  With the port of mytonctrl I could test mining (when it was available) and advanced in running a full node.
4. The ports are [ton that compiles from ton-blockchain/ton](https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/adJ/tree/main/arboldes/usr/ports/mystuff/net/ton) and [ton-toncli that compiles from SpyCheese/ton to be used with toncli](https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/adJ/tree/main/arboldes/usr/ports/mystuff/net/ton-toncli).  The ongoing port of mytonctrl is on branch adJ of <https://github.com/vtamara/mytonctrl/tree/adJ>

6. Adding up, experimenting, fixing and keeping more on less updated like 1 month.  (It has required [modifying the operating system](https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/adJ/commit/59c4fb4751b478a092db9ac1ad56160dd2a0a400), overcoming problems with the [library abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/issues/1153), experimenting and persisting until having [a patch accepted in ton](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/430), etc.)
7. Keep updating the ports as ton, SpyChees/ton and mytonctrl are upated. Complete mytonctrl port.
8. I wish to run a collator node on adJ/OpenBSD. I wish the changes to [mypylib](https://github.com/igroman787/mypylib/pull/6) (required by `mytonctrl`) would receive some feedback from `mypylib` author.
9. I have not received grants neither awards for the ports  --collaterally I received awards for around  US$1300 for competing in FunC competitions in 2022 and for an [article about FunC with toncli on adJ](https://medium.com/@vladimirtmara/developing-and-testing-a-simple-smart-contract-with-toncli-de96ad0a6f5c)
