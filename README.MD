🏆 Personal award by Anatoly Makosov

**$112 000** from my own funds to the tonscan.org team.

Source code https://github.com/catchain/tonscan.

Many of us use https://tonscan.org explorer on a daily basis.

It works great, and in my opinion is an example of excellent UI / UX of TON explorer, while https://tonapi.io excelled significantly in the backend and indexing, and https://dton.io in statistics and some other features.

It is also worth noting that tonscan team were among the first to implement new TON releases (such as TON DNS or TON Nominators) and are ready to work together on some features.

I wish the tonscan team further develop the service and invent new approaches in blockchain user interfaces.

🏆 Personal award by Anatoly Makosov and Kirill Emelyanenko

**$112 000** from our own funds to the [Disintar](https://dton.io/) team.

The well-known team of strong developers, which developed the popular [toncli](https://github.com/disintar/toncli) development tool, the ton-k8s tools for running a private TON testnet, the first [GraphQL TON API](https://dton.io/graphql/) and the https://dton.io explorer based on it.

We can also mention the https://disintar.io marketplace which is part of the TON NFT ecosystem.

We hope to see new hardcore developments from them this year.
