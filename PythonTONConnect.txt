1. Python TON Connect library.
2. A library that implements TON Connect (v1) in Python.
3. The library works as intended. It was originally developed for my personal projects and wasn't widely used, however, some people found it useful and applied it to their needs.
4. https://github.com/stspbu/ton-connect
5. Viacheslav Bushev (@vbushev).
6. 1-2 weeks.
7. TON Connect v1 has recently been deprecated, so the library should be upgraded to v2.
8. It would be great to fork / move the library in Tonkeeper repository, near typescript implementation: https://github.com/tonkeeper/ton-connect.
9. Nothing received yet.
